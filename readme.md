# Lucky Essentials

Lucky Essentials is a plugin mainly created to replace EssentialsX's essential features in minigame servers such as /gmc, /fly, /tp, /tphere, /top, etc and also replace some useful plugins in minigame servers such as MYSlots and EasyWhitelist. I created this because essentials has a lot of useless feature for a minigame server, such as /sethome, /warp, /seen, etc and will only make the server slower/heavier...
